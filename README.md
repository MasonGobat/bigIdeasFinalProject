Ian's dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data/resource/044f2016-1dfd-4ab0-bc1e-065da05fca2e
My dataset contains the type of crime committed, an integer value scaling how severe the crime was, the neighborhood the crime was committed in, the time of the incident, and other integers relating to the location of the crime.

Matthew's dataset:  https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02
My dataset contains the number of fire incidents that were responded to by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. This dataset contains the date, location, type of fire, and other related information about each incident. This set contains the fire incidents from 2013 through 2017. 

Mason's dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps
My dataset contains data for each speedhump in the city of Pittsburgh. The data contained on each speedhump is their address, both street and actual address they are closest too, the material they are made of and also which neighborhood that they are located in. There is also information for police and fire zone that they are in.


Our repository aims to find the best neighborhood in all of Pittsburgh in terms of safety by utilizing three datasets regarding, crime, fires, and speed humps.
