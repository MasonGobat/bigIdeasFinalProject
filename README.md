Ian's dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data/resource/044f2016-1dfd-4ab0-bc1e-065da05fca2e
My dataset contains the type of crime committed, an integer value scaling how severe the crime was, the neighborhood the crime was committed in, the time of the incident, and other integers relating to the location of the crime.
